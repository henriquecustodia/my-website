Hey there!

I'm a Senior Frontend Developer based in Brazil. And yes, it's a great country with a lot of nice things, such as nature and culture, that make me very proud of living here.

I love coding. I know it's a bit cliché coming from a programmer, but, for real, I love what I do.

Coding for me is like playing football or my guitar, I really enjoy it. Maybe because I feel that I don't have any distractions when I'm writing some code and thinking about problem solutions. Well, maybe the feeling of solving a problem is what I love, and with code, I solve these problems.

Since I started working as a programmer, I've always liked front-end development. The reason? I don't know exactly. I think it's because I like to create visual things—not as a designer, of course, but more like someone who can turn tons of code into colored, meaningful things.

As a frontend developer, I've been focusing on creating great applications with Angular lately. That framework always caught my eye. I think it's because it has a very OOP approach, it looks so organized to me. Features such as dependency injection, directives, and forms are great things in Angular.

The first language that I learned was Java (actually, it was Portugol, but you probably never heard about it), and I think that's why I like Angular so much. Well, that makes sense, right? I hope so.

I'm the founder of Code Dimension, a platform focused on teaching Angular and front-end technologies. Furthermore, I talk a lot about trending news in the Angular universe and also share all my knowledge about it on YouTube and in online courses. [Check out Code Dimension's YouTube channel if you're curious about the amazing content shared there](https://www.youtube.com/@code.dimension).

A bit more about me:

- I'm a musician. I'm not a professional, but I like to create songs. I play many instruments and sing too.
- Furthermore, I'm a fan of football, especially the Premier League. My favorite team is Aston Villa.
- I play football as well. I'm a defender.
- I have two cats. I prefer cats to dogs or any other kind of pet. Maybe because they're very quiet and clean.
- And last but not least important, I'm a tattoo lover.

If you're curious to know how it's my appearance, the guy right below is me.

I think that's all for now. Don't hesitate to reach out to me by [email](mailto:martinshenrique8@gmail.com) or direct message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henriquecustodia/), whether you want to talk about any subject.

Thank you for reading up to this point, and enjoy the journey!
